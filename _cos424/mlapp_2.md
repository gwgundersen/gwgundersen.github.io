## Introduction

> Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation. â€“ Pierre Laplace (p. 27)

Two interpretations of probability:

1. **Frequentist**: "Probabilities represent long run frequencies of events." (p. 28)

2. **Bayesian**: "Probability is used to quantify our **uncertainty** about something; hence it is fundamentally related to information rather than repeated trials... One big advantage of the Bayesian interpretation is that it can be used to model our uncertainty about events that do not have long term frequencies [e.g. melting of the polar ice caps]." (p. 28)

## Independence

- Unconditional independence:

$$
X \perp Y = p(X,Y) = p(X)p(Y)
$$

- Conditional independence:

$$
X \perp Y = p(X,Y|Z) = p(X|Z)p(Y|Z)
$$

    - This assumption "allows us to build large probabilistic models from small pieces."
