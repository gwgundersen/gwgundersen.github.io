# Expectation of a discrete random variable

Let $X$ be a discrete random variable such that $X: \Omega \rightarrow D$, $\phi: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The expectation is defined as:

$$
\mathbb{E}(\phi(X)) = \sum_{X \in D} \phi(X) \mathbb{P}(\{X=x\})
$$

Why does this make no sense for continuous random variables? Because $\mathbb{P}(\{X=x\}) = 0$ for continuous random variables.

[TODO: Image of plot of discrete random variable expectation.]

$$
\mathbb{E}(\phi(X)) = \phi(x_1) \mathbb{P}(\{X=x_1\}) + \phi(x_2) \mathbb{P}(\{X=x_2\}) + ...
$$

For any value $x_i$, what is $\phi(x_i) \mathbb{P}(\{X=x_i\})$? Just the _area_.

[TODO: Image of small area of q(a) * P(a)]

$$
\mathbb{E}(\phi(X)) = \text{"Area under the curve of $\omega \rightarrow X(\omega)$"}
$$


# Expectation of a continuous random variable

Let $X$ be a continuous random variable such that $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Since it is continuous, we may have a smooth curve. What is the area in this case?

This suggests the following definition:

> **Definition.** Let $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous random variable. Then:

> $$
> \mathbb{E}(\phi(X)) = \lim_{|x_i - x_{i+1}| \rightarrow 0} \sum_{x_i \in \Omega} \phi(x_i) \mathbb{P}(\{x_i < X < x_{i+1}\})
> $$
